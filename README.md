# System Monitoring Dashboard — README

This project is a small cross-platform system monitoring and process management tool built with Tkinter.

File
- `import tkinter as tk.py` — main application source (recommend renaming to `system_dashboard.py` to avoid confusion with module import syntax).

Dependencies
- `tkinter` — Python's standard GUI toolkit; used for the UI (labels, listbox, buttons, dialogs).
- `psutil` (optional but recommended) — cross-platform library used for:
  - CPU usage (`psutil.cpu_percent`) and per-process CPU usage (`Process.cpu_percent`).
  - Memory usage (`psutil.virtual_memory`).
  - Process enumeration (`psutil.process_iter`) and process termination/inspection (`psutil.Process`).
  If not installed, the program falls back to limited Unix-only `/proc` and `ps` behavior where available.
- Standard library modules used:
  - `subprocess` — used as a fallback to call system tools like `ps` or `taskkill` when psutil is not available.
  - `time` — used for short sampling delays when needed.
  - `platform` — to detect OS for fallbacks and platform-specific commands.
  - `os` — general OS utilities (imported for potential extension).
  - `messagebox` from `tkinter` — dialogs for errors, confirmations and process info.

What the program reads / uses at runtime
- On systems with `psutil` installed (recommended):
  - CPU percentage via `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.1)`.
  - Memory stats via `psutil.virtual_memory()`.
  - Process list via `psutil.process_iter(['pid','name','username'])`, and then per-process `cpu_percent()` and `memory_percent()`.
  - Process details: `p.exe()`, `p.cmdline()`, `p.username()`, `p.status()`, `p.num_threads()`, `p.memory_info()`.

- If `psutil` is NOT installed:
  - On Linux the script tries to read `/proc/stat` and `/proc/meminfo` to compute CPU and memory usage. Note: `/proc` is Linux-specific and does not exist on Windows.
  - For processes the script falls back to running `ps aux` and parsing its output (Unix-only). To kill processes it will call `kill -9` (Unix) or `taskkill` (Windows when the fallback path is used).

Why psutil is recommended
- `psutil` provides a reliable, cross-platform way to collect system stats and manage processes. It removes platform-specific parsing of `/proc` and `ps` output and avoids many edge cases.

UI behavior and features
- Top labels show:
  - CPU Usage (updated every second via Tkinter's `after` loop). Uses a short sampling interval to produce a meaningful percent.
  - Memory Usage (updated every second).
- Process list area:
  - Lists processes with PID, CPU%, MEM%, User and command.
  - Options to filter system processes (checkbox) and sort by CPU, memory, PID, or name.
  - Double-click a process to inspect details (executable, cmdline, user, status, thread count, memory).
  - Select a process and click "Kill Selected Process" to attempt to terminate it. The script attempts graceful `terminate()` first, then `kill()` if necessary. On Windows, it uses `taskkill` as a fallback.

Threading and UI safety
- The code uses Tkinter's `after()` scheduling to update CPU and memory values on the main thread. This avoids updating Tk widgets from background threads (which raises "main thread is not in main loop" errors).

Permissions and limitations
- Killing processes often requires elevated privileges. If a kill or inspection fails due to permission, the app shows an error dialog.
- Per-process CPU percent may appear as 0.0 initially; psutil usually needs a sampling interval to compute CPU percentages.
- If `psutil` is missing on Windows, many features will be limited because the fallback is Unix-specific.

How to run
1. (Recommended) Install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r "c:\Users\Bharath\OneDrive\Desktop\python\requirements.txt"
```

2. Run the app:

```powershell
python "c:\Users\Bharath\OneDrive\Desktop\python\import tkinter as tk.py"
```

Notes and suggestions
- Rename the file to `system_dashboard.py` to avoid confusion with the `import tkinter as tk` syntax.
- Consider running the script from an elevated prompt if you need to kill system processes.
- You can add filtering, alert thresholds (e.g., highlight processes using > X% CPU), or export a snapshot of processes to CSV as future enhancements.

Troubleshooting
- If you see FileNotFoundError for `/proc/stat` on Windows: install `psutil` or run under WSL/Linux. The updated script prefers psutil and should not attempt `/proc` on Windows.
- If the GUI crashes with "main thread is not in main loop", ensure the script is the updated one that uses `after()` rather than a background thread.

Contact / Follow-ups
- If you want, I can:
  - Rename the file and update run instructions automatically.
  - Add a small README section for troubleshooting common permission errors on Windows.
  - Add an export (CSV) and a small alerting UI.
